**Project1**
*Goal 1*

Create a Polygon class with the properties shown. The initializer for the class will need the number of vertices (or edges, same), and the circumradius (R).
Make sure you test all your methods and properties. (This is called unit testing)

*Goal 2*
Create a finite sequence type that is a sequence of Polygons start with 3 vertices, up to, and including some maximum value m which will need to be passed to the initializer of the sequence type. The value for the circumradius R, will also need to be provided to the initializer.
